        <h1 id="about_me"><center>About Me</center></h1>
        <h5 id="para1aboutme">Welcome! Sreyam Bhattacharjee, known online as LetDowntoVoid or simply 'Void'. Born on 25th May, 2008 in India, Void is fascinated by programming and hacking. He wants to grow up (POV: YOU DID NOT GROW UP YET.) and be an ethical hacker. At the moment though, he is still a kid, and wants to remain the same. Void thinks: "Being young is having a fresh mind." and he is not wrong. He has a fresh mind. Just... not a mature one. :P </h5>
        <h5 id="Para2aboutme">
              Now Void is studing in year 9 (Grade 9/Class 9). He takes up Mathematics, Science and Computer Applications. He likes school, very much. Except for one part. Getting bullied. Uhhh yeah Void gets bullied. A lot. He does not really care about it. As I was saying: Void likes school, and is exited everyday to visit school. Why? Because he is curoious. [Discord Users be like: NERD ALERT ðŸ¤“ (imagine.)]<br> <br> <br>

          Okay So quick story time here: Void was in school one day and someone just comes up to him and says "Ratio.". Void asks what was that for [NOTICE: 'Ratio' is from a language from Twitter. If you don't know wut that is: Search it up online idk why won't you do that.] and he replies "Nerd.". Void still has no idea what that guys context was... Uhh Story time done. 
          <br>
          <br>
          </h5> 
          <h5 id="Para3AboutMe">
            Anyway Void enjoy's his school life. And thats what I think that matters. He has no friends though
            <a class="mansadgeandIagree" id="sadness"> [insert meme titanic song here *click here or hover something idk*].</a>
            Which I dont think he really cares about because who needs friends <br> w h e n y o u c a n m a k e t h e m.

            Yeah that's right, Void is interested in AI (Artificial Intelligence)! Fancy, innit? At the time, he is holding his horses. He is working on a Roblox game. Cl0ver. Why? He does not know.

            var beep = $("#RROLL")[0];
            $("#sadness")
            .mouseenter(function(){
              
              beep.play();
              
            })

    <h5 id="upto_H5_P1">
      Well... Void tries many things. As I said: Void is extremely into Techonology, Internet, Hacking, Game Development, Discord Bot Development, Roblox Game Development because he left Game Development cause he found out C# was a pain to code with. He tried his best. I think... I dunno really... But he is really focusssed on the other things I listed there. Currently he is developing an Roblox Game: Cl0ver. He wants it to be an RPG, 2D-ish, Story type game. He has 0 idea how he wants to define it... Now that, is called proper planning amirite ^ . - ? <br><br>
